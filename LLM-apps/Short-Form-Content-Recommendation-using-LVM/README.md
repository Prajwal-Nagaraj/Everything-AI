In this folder I will include a notebook where I will be creating a basic content based recommendation system using LLaVa-NeXT-Video, a Large Vision-Language Model (LVM) that can ingest videos, 
to label and extract features from short-form videos, such as those on TikTok and Instagram Reels. To test the recommendation pipeline I will be using stock videos downloaded from pexels.

Additionaly, this model can also be used to tag images and videos with their respective descriptions and these descriptions can be stored in a Vector Store which can later be retrieved for RAG(Retrieval Augmented Generation) applications.
