In this folder I will include a notebook where I will be creating a basic content based recommendation system using LLaVa-NeXT-Video, a Large Vision-Language Model (LVM) that can ingest videos, 
to label and extract features from short-form videos, such as those on TikTok and Instagram Reels. To test the recommendation pipeline I will be using stock videos downloaded from pexels.
