In this notebook, I will be exploring an open source model that was recently launched on Huggingface and is specifically built for video generation via prompting. More information about this models can be found [here]([https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/releases/tag/v0.30.0])

I will also be uploading all the gifs that I've generated into the gifs folder.
