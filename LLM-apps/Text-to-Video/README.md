In this notebook, I will be exploring an open source model built using the diffusers package andthat was recently launched on Huggingface and is specifically built for video generation via prompting. More information about this models can be found [here]([url](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/releases/tag/v0.30.0)).

I will also be uploading all the gifs that I've generated into the gifs folder.
