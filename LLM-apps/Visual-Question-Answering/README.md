## Visual Question Answering

In this folder, I will be utilizing open source visual languages models such as Idefics2-8b, Qwen2-VL and LLaVa-OneVision to process images of documents and extract information from them. These model is specifically trained for Visual Question Answering and can match, or even outperform, some closed-source services such as AWS Textract or Azure Document Intelligence. One of the key advantages of this model is its open-source nature, which allows for fine-tuning to meet specific task requirements.
