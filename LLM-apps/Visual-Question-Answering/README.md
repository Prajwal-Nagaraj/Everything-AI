## Visual Question Answering

In this folder, I will be utilizing Idefics2-8b, an open-source language model designed to process images of documents and extract information from them. This model is specifically trained for Visual Question Answering and can match, or even outperform, some closed-source services such as AWS Textract or Azure Document Intelligence. One of the key advantages of this model is its open-source nature, which allows for fine-tuning to meet specific task requirements.
