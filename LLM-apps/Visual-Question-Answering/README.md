## Visual Question Answering

In this folder, I will be using Idefics2-8b an open source Language model that takes in image of a document and extracts information from the input documents. This model was specifically trained for Visual Quesiton answering and can easily match and even outperform some of the closed source services such as AWS Textract or Azure Document Intelligence. Another advantage of this model is that it can be fine tuned for specific tasks as it is open sourced.
