The notebook in this folder can be used to fine tune Idefics2-8B which is Visual Question Answering model from HuggingFace. As this model is open source it can be fine tuned on custom data and can be 
used to extract information, describe one or multiple images, answer questions about the input images and create stories grounded on multiple images. For my particular use case, I will be fine tuning the model
to extract information from images of documents.
