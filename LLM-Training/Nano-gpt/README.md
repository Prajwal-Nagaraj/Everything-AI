In this notebook I will be building a ~11M parameter Transformer based character level decoder model which will endlessely produce questions, the prize for that 
question and answer to the question based on the popular game show 'Jeopardy'. This notebook is a direct implementation of Andrej Karpathy's 
'[Let's Build GPT]([url](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=5a2Lroae5QRs_-bl))' video. I will also include the data used to train the model in this folder.
